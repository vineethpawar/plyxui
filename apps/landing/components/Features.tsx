  { title: ".ts / .native.ts splits", body: "Metro picks native, Webpack/Vite/Next/Electron pick web. Same public API, sane platform-specific internals." },
  { title: "VS Code webview-ready", body: "@plyxui/vscode auto-themes to the IDE — light, dark, both high-contrast variants. Components inherit the user's active editor accent. CSP-safe." },
  { title: "Icon registry", body: "Names autocomplete, names extend. Built around a typed registry, not per-file imports." },
  { title: "Router-agnostic", body: "defineRoutes() once, render with the react-router or react-navigation adapter. Same routes table powers Sidebar + tabs." },
